    <h2>Challenge Goals</h2>
    <p>Link: <a href="https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/23/">Link to the Data Challenge by QRT HERE</a></p>
    <p>The proposed challenge aims at predicting the return of a stock in the US market using historical data over a recent period of 20 days. The one-day return of a stock <em>j</em> on day <em>t</em> with price <em>P<sub>j</sub><sup>t</sup></em> (adjusted from dividends and stock splits) is given by:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( R_{j}^{t} = \frac{P_{j}^{t}}{P_{j}^{t-1}} - 1 \)
    </div>
    <p>In this challenge, we consider the residual stock return, which corresponds to the return of a stock without the market impact. Historical data are composed of residual stock returns and relative volumes, sampled each day during the 20 last business days (approximately one month). The relative volume <em>V<sub>j</sub><sup>t</sup></em> at time <em>t</em> of a stock <em>j</em> among the <em>n</em> stocks is defined by:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \overline{V}_{j}^{t} = \frac{V^{t}}{\text{median}(\{V_{j}^{t-1}, \ldots, V_{j}^{t-20}\})} \)
    </div>
    <div class="math">
        \( V_{j}^{t} = \overline{V}_{j}^{t} - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \overline{V}_{i}^{t} \)
    </div>
    <p>where <em>V^{t}</em> is the volume at time <em>t</em> of a stock <em>j</em>. We also give additional information about each stock such as its industry and sector.</p>
    <p>The metric considered is the accuracy of the predicted residual stock return sign.</p>

    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>The dataset comprises 46 descriptive features (all float/int values):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DATE</strong>: an index of the date (the dates are randomized and anonymized so there is no continuity or link between any dates),</li>
        <li><strong>STOCK</strong>: an index of the stock,</li>
        <li><strong>INDUSTRY</strong>: an index of the stock industry domain (e.g., aeronautic, IT, oil company),</li>
        <li><strong>INDUSTRY_GROUP</strong>: an index of the group industry,</li>
        <li><strong>SUB_INDUSTRY</strong>: a lower level index of the industry,</li>
        <li><strong>SECTOR</strong>: an index of the work sector,</li>
        <li><strong>RET_1 to RET_20</strong>: the historical residual returns among the last 20 days (i.e., RET_1 is the return of the previous day and so on),</li>
        <li><strong>VOLUME_1 to VOLUME_20</strong>: the historical relative volume traded among the last 20 days (i.e., VOLUME_1 is the relative volume of the previous day and so on).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Output datasets are only composed of 2 columns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ID</strong>: the unique row identifier (corresponding to the input identifiers) and the binary target:</li>
        <li><strong>RET</strong>: the sign of the residual stock return at time <em>t</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The solution files submitted by participants shall follow this output dataset format (i.e., contain only two columns, ID and RET, where the ID values correspond to the input test data). An example submission file containing random predictions is provided.</p>
    <p>418,595 observations (i.e., lines) are available for the training datasets while 198,429 observations are used for the test datasets.</p>

    <h2>Target Variable</h2>
    <p><strong>RET</strong>: The sign of the residual stock return at time <em>t</em> (binary).</p>

    <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
    <p>To enhance the dataset and improve prediction accuracy, the following feature engineering techniques were applied:</p>
    <h3>1. Volatility Measures</h3>
    <p><strong>Rolling Standard Deviation</strong>:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \text{Rolling Std} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (R_i - \overline{R})^2} \)
    </div>
    <p><strong>Volatility of Volatility (Vol of Vol)</strong> (std of std):</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \text{Vol of Vol} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\sigma_i - \overline{\sigma})^2} \)
    </div>

    </div>


    <h3>2. Technical Indicators</h3>
    <p><strong>Money Flow Index (MFI)</strong>:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \text{MFI} = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\sum(\text{Positive Money Flow})}{\sum(\text{Negative Money Flow})}} \right) \)
    </div>
    <p><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</strong>:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \text{RSI} = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}} \right) \)
    </div>
    <p><strong>Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL)</strong>:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \text{ADL} = \sum \left( \frac{(C - L) - (H - C)}{H - L} \times V \right) \)
    </div>
    <p><strong>Average True Range (ATR)</strong>:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \text{ATR} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{TR}_i \)
    </div>
    <p><strong>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</strong>:</p>
    <div class="math">
        \( \text{MACD} = \text{EMA}_{12} - \text{EMA}_{26} \)
    </div>

    <h3>3. Feature Engineering</h3>
    <p><strong>Technical Indicators</strong>: To extract information from our small dataset, technical indicators have been coded. I picked typical technical indicators and hard-coded them myself. Typically these can be found in the TA-Lib library though:</p>

        <img src="/files/stock_1_analysis_ret_5.png" alt="Technical analysis of stock 1 ret 5" width="600"/>
        <figcaption>Figure 5: Technical analysis of stock 1 ret 5</figcaption>

    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Volatility Indicators: Volatility (Std), Volatility of Volatility (std of std) per stock and per sector and per stock adjusted per sector.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Statistical Indicators</strong>: To extract more information, I considered also factor investing. Factor investing has been already extensively covered in literature. The most pleasant read I have found recently about this is Chapter 7 of the new book of Giuseppe Paleologo <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/dcjs09n8o1n9who0vo4nl/AAPjHxg0j0CRJ5me1OKF7JE/NYU%20notes%20Giuseppe?rlkey=liz1nlorbnzzolzhyv88sp69u&e=1&dl=0">here</a>. Nonetheless, the way I went about it is straightforward. I have calculated Principal Components per SECTOR and INDUSTRY (aggregated per stock category), because this is where our time series lie, both whitened and not whitened. These didn’t seem to have a positive impact in terms of explainability of our target variable RET as much as the Technical Indicators, so you will find this at the end of the notebook.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h3>4. Prediction Model</h3>
    <p>The model is a Random Forest applied with stratified cross-validation, to ensure proper assessment and avoid overfitting to any training part of the dataset.</p>
    <h3>5. Submission to the leaderboard</h3>
    <p><strong>Outcome</strong>: As of today while writing this notebook: in the leaderboard, I am the <strong>70th submission out of 399 submissions</strong>, I am in the <strong>top 17.3% percentile of submissions</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>Future ideas include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Think about how to leverage <strong>kurtosis</strong> and skewness of the distributions for statistically-driven feature engineering and indicators</li>
        <li>Read more extensively <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/dcjs09n8o1n9who0vo4nl/AAPjHxg0j0CRJ5me1OKF7JE/NYU%20notes%20Giuseppe?rlkey=liz1nlorbnzzolzhyv88sp69u&e=1&dl=0">Giuseppe’s notes</a> and get inspiration about more statistically and mathematically proven and robust methods to derive alpha</li>
    </ul>
