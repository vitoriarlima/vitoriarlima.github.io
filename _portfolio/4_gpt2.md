## Overview

This project explores the fine-tuning of the GPT-2 model using Wiktionary data to enhance its ability to generate dictionary-style content. The aim is to adapt GPT-2 to model the relationship between words, definitions, and example usages.

### Key Objectives

1. **Data Acquisition**: Compile structured dictionary data from Wiktionary.
2. **Model Fine-tuning**: Adapt GPT-2 to handle dictionary entries effectively.
3. **Evaluation**: Analyze the model's performance in generating definitions and example usages.

### Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Utilize Wiktionary as the primary data source for definitions, examples, and related linguistic information.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model on the collected data, structuring the dataset for optimal learning.
- **Evaluation Techniques**: Use matrix decomposition techniques to understand the learned word embeddings and features.

### Findings

- **Language Generation**: The fine-tuned model effectively generates accurate definitions and usage examples for given words.
- **Representation Analysis**: Dimensionality reduction techniques reveal insights into the learned features and biases of the model.

### Conclusion

The project demonstrates the potential of fine-tuning large language models for specialized tasks, providing valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of GPT-2 in dictionary-based language generation.
